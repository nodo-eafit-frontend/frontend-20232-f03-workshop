### Create a Survey Form with A11y best practices

Many times users have problems with web pages due to situations with:

- Not having vision 👓
- They don't have a mouse 🖱️
- They have low vision🔬
- They cannot detect all colors 🖌️

Therefore, you have to design and develop a form that allows you to create a new cooking recipe. Take into account all the elements that compose the template of your cooking recipe.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [] The form can be filled out using only the keyboard.
- [] The page can be navigated at 200% magnification.
- [] The page must use contrasting colors.
- [] The form must be able to be redirected to the cooking recipe page.
- [] The form and the cooking recipe page must use atomic design & BEM methodology.
