                <h3>Step By Step:</h3>

                    <p><strong>Peel and chop</strong> the kiwis into small pieces or slices,<br> 
                        then place them into a bowl. In order to add the sugar later.<br>
                        <strong>Stir well</strong> until everything is mixed.<br>
                        <strong>Transfer the mixture </strong>into a pot and <strong>bring it to a boil </strong>over high heat. 
                        <br>Once it starts boiling, <strong>reduce the heat to medium-low </strong><br>
                        and <strong>simmer</strong> for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes.<br>
                        To check if the jam is ready, perform the cold plate test:<br>
                        take a few drops of jam from the pot and place them on a cold plate.<br> 
                        If it thickens, it's ready.<br>
                        Sterilize some jars beforehand and <strong>store the jam</strong> in them<br>
                    </p>

            <h2>Did you know...?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a tea towel folded four times on the bottom <br>
                    of a pressure cooker. Fill the cooker to about three fingers of height <br>
                    from the bottom, depending on the size of the jar are using. Place it  <br>
                    on the heat and wait for it to start boiling.</li>

                <li>Fill the jars (clean and sterilized) with the jam you've prepared, leaving <br>
                    about one finger of space from the top of the edge. Seal the jars and and <br>
                    introduce them into a pot and individually wrap them with a cloth to prevent <br>
                    them from breaking when they come into contact with each other.</li>

                <li>Close the pot, and when steam begins to escape, let it cook <br>
                    for 20 to 25 minutes (this time is suitable for three medium-sized jars). <br>
                    Then, turn off the heat and allow all the steam to escape through the valve.</li>
                <li>Remove the jars and let them cool upside down at room temperature for 24 HOURS.</li>
            </ol>
