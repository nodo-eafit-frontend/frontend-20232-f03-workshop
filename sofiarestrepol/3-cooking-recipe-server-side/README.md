### Create a Server Side with API + CRUD & Node + express

In this exercise, students will have the opportunity to create a server-side application using technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. The application will consist of building an API (Application Programming Interface) with CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations to manage data.

- The data should be related to cooking recipes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Functional API:**

  - The API must have routes to create, read, update and delete data related to the chosen topic (e.g. users, products, etc.).
  - It must be possible to perform CRUD operations using the corresponding routes.

- [ ] **Data Persistence:** Data must be persisted in a database or file so that it is not lost when the server is restarted. The persisted data will be JSON files.
- [ ] **Middleware and Error Handling:**
  - Use middleware to handle requests, responses and errors efficiently.
  - Implement error handling for paths that do not exist or for internal server errors.
